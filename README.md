# SpaceX Deep Dive Remake
A booking website for SpaceX

## How it Started
A year ago I was working with a team on a school project for the Deep Dive, the theme was SpaceX. We were supposed to make a booking website for the Starports and rocketships that bring you to the other side of the world.

A few weeks or months I was looking back at the code and I thought "Ew, what's that!". Kept in my mind that we had to learn php in a week, yet I found it awful to look at. So why not remake it? Here I am, redoing all the styling and functionality, this time without a CSS framwork since I have enough time!
